[Singpore-gopher](http://singapore-gopher.github.io) is a community of programmers and hobbyists who use Go in Singapore.

## Upcoming

We have a meetup coming up this May:

### Writing testable code in Go
*by Ryan Dao, from PayPal*

Ryan will be talking about their coding practice, such that all there Go services can be thoroughly tested.
Expect to here about using interfaces, dependecy injection :D This is a good talk if you are using / planning to adopt Go.

### Coding challenge
The JSON challenge last time was fun (some people were glued to their screen after even after we had finished).
So we will try something along that line again. Bring your laptop :D

### Who we are

Some of us are developers, some writes Go code in the weekend for fun. We even have Gophers who contributes back to *the source*: [creators of Go framework](https://github.com/astaxie/beego) and [book author](http://www.manning.com/chang/).

We come together to talk about technology, our love/hate relationships with Go and generally, have a good time.
