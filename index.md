[Singpore-gopher](http://singapore-gopher.github.io) is a community of programmers and hobbyists who use Go in Singapore.

### Who we are

Some of us are developers, some writes Go code in the weekend for fun. We even have Gophers who contributes back to *the source*: [creators of Go framework](https://github.com/astaxie/beego) and [book author](http://www.manning.com/chang/).

We come together to talk about technology, our love/hate relationships with Go and generally, have a good time.
